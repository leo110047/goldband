## Preamble (run first)

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.workflow
mkdir -p ~/.workflow/sessions
touch ~/.workflow/sessions/"$PPID"
_SESSIONS=$(find ~/.workflow/sessions -mmin -120 -type f 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
find ~/.workflow/sessions -mmin +120 -type f -delete 2>/dev/null || true
_CONTRIB=$(~/.claude/skills/workflow/bin/workflow-config get workflow_contributor 2>/dev/null || true)
_PROACTIVE=$(~/.claude/skills/workflow/bin/workflow-config get proactive 2>/dev/null || echo "true")
_EXPLAIN_LEVEL=$(~/.claude/skills/workflow/bin/workflow-config get explain_level 2>/dev/null || echo "default")
_QUESTION_TUNING=$(~/.claude/skills/workflow/bin/workflow-config get question_tuning 2>/dev/null || echo "false")
_WRITING_PENDING=$([ -f ~/.workflow/.writing-style-prompt-pending ] && echo "yes" || echo "no")
_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown")
echo "BRANCH: $_BRANCH"
echo "PROACTIVE: $_PROACTIVE"
echo "EXPLAIN_LEVEL: $_EXPLAIN_LEVEL"
echo "QUESTION_TUNING: $_QUESTION_TUNING"
echo "WRITING_STYLE_PENDING: $_WRITING_PENDING"
source <(~/.claude/skills/workflow/bin/workflow-repo-mode 2>/dev/null) || true
REPO_MODE=${REPO_MODE:-unknown}
echo "REPO_MODE: $REPO_MODE"
_LAKE_SEEN=$([ -f ~/.workflow/.completeness-intro-seen ] && echo "yes" || echo "no")
echo "LAKE_INTRO: $_LAKE_SEEN"
mkdir -p ~/.workflow/analytics
echo '{"skill":"setup-browser-cookies","ts":"'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'","repo":"'$(basename "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)" 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown")'"}'  >> ~/.workflow/analytics/skill-usage.jsonl 2>/dev/null || true
```

If `PROACTIVE` is `"false"`, do not proactively suggest workflow skills — only invoke
them when the user explicitly asks. The user opted out of proactive suggestions.

If `WRITING_STYLE_PENDING` is `yes`: You're on the first skill run after upgrading
to workflow v1. Ask the user once about the new default writing style. Use AskUserQuestion:

> v1 prompts = simpler. Technical terms get a one-sentence gloss on first use,
> questions are framed in outcome terms, sentences are shorter.
>
> Keep the new default, or prefer the older tighter prose?

Options:
- A) Keep the new default (recommended — good writing helps everyone)
- B) Restore V0 prose — set `explain_level: terse`

If A: leave `explain_level` unset (defaults to `default`).
If B: run `~/.claude/skills/workflow/bin/workflow-config set explain_level terse`.

Always run (regardless of choice):
```bash
rm -f ~/.workflow/.writing-style-prompt-pending
touch ~/.workflow/.writing-style-prompted
```

This only happens once. If `WRITING_STYLE_PENDING` is `no`, skip this entirely.

If `LAKE_INTRO` is `no`: Before continuing, introduce the Completeness Principle.
Tell the user: "workflow follows the **Boil the Lake** principle — always do the complete
thing when AI makes the marginal cost near-zero. Read more: https://garryslist.org/posts/boil-the-ocean"
Then offer to open the essay in their default browser:

```bash
open https://garryslist.org/posts/boil-the-ocean
touch ~/.workflow/.completeness-intro-seen
```

Only run `open` if the user says yes. Always run `touch` to mark as seen. This only happens once.

## Contributor Mode

If `_CONTRIB` is `true`: you are in **contributor mode**. At the end of each major workflow step, rate your workflow experience 0-10. If not a 10 and there's an actionable bug or improvement — file a field report.

**File only:** workflow tooling bugs where the input was reasonable but workflow failed. **Skip:** user app bugs, network errors, auth failures on user's site.

**To file:** write `~/.workflow/contributor-logs/{slug}.md`:
```
# {Title}
**What I tried:** {action} | **What happened:** {result} | **Rating:** {0-10}
## Repro
1. {step}
## What would make this a 10
{one sentence}
**Date:** {YYYY-MM-DD} | **Version:** {version} | **Skill:** /{skill}
```
Slug: lowercase hyphens, max 60 chars. Skip if exists. Max 3/session. File inline, don't stop.

## Completion Status Protocol

When completing a skill workflow, report status using one of:
- **DONE** — All steps completed successfully. Evidence provided for each claim.
- **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS** — Completed, but with issues the user should know about. List each concern.
- **BLOCKED** — Cannot proceed. State what is blocking and what was tried.
- **NEEDS_CONTEXT** — Missing information required to continue. State exactly what you need.

### Escalation

It is always OK to stop and say "this is too hard for me" or "I'm not confident in this result."

Bad work is worse than no work. You will not be penalized for escalating.
- If you have attempted a task 3 times without success, STOP and escalate.
- If you are uncertain about a security-sensitive change, STOP and escalate.
- If the scope of work exceeds what you can verify, STOP and escalate.

Escalation format:
```
STATUS: BLOCKED | NEEDS_CONTEXT
REASON: [1-2 sentences]
ATTEMPTED: [what you tried]
RECOMMENDATION: [what the user should do next]
```

## Plan Status Footer

When you are in plan mode and about to call ExitPlanMode:

1. Check if the plan file already has a `## WORKFLOW REVIEW REPORT` section.
2. If it DOES — skip (a review skill already wrote a richer report).
3. If it does NOT — run this command:

\`\`\`bash
~/.claude/skills/workflow/bin/workflow-review-read
\`\`\`

Then write a `## WORKFLOW REVIEW REPORT` section to the end of the plan file:

- If the output contains review entries (JSONL lines before `---CONFIG---`): format the
  standard report table with runs/status/findings per skill, same format as the review
  skills use.
- If the output is `NO_REVIEWS` or empty: write this placeholder table:

\`\`\`markdown
## WORKFLOW REVIEW REPORT

| Review | Trigger | Why | Runs | Status | Findings |
|--------|---------|-----|------|--------|----------|
| CEO Review | \`/plan-ceo-review\` | Scope & strategy | 0 | — | — |
| Codex Review | \`/codex review\` | Independent 2nd opinion | 0 | — | — |
| Eng Review | \`/plan-eng-review\` | Architecture & tests (required) | 0 | — | — |
| Design Review | \`/plan-design-review\` | UI/UX gaps | 0 | — | — |

**VERDICT:** NO REVIEWS YET — run \`/autoplan\` for full review pipeline, or individual reviews above.
\`\`\`

**PLAN MODE EXCEPTION — ALWAYS RUN:** This writes to the plan file, which is the one
file you are allowed to edit in plan mode. The plan file review report is part of the
plan's living status.

# Setup Browser Cookies

Import logged-in sessions from your real Chromium browser into the headless browse session.

## How it works

1. Find the browse binary
2. Run `cookie-import-browser` to detect installed browsers and open the picker UI
3. User selects which cookie domains to import in their browser
4. Cookies are decrypted and loaded into the Playwright session

## Steps

### 1. Find the browse binary

## SETUP (run this check BEFORE any browse command)

```bash
_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)
B=""
[ -n "$_ROOT" ] && [ -x "$_ROOT/.claude/skills/workflow/browse/dist/browse" ] && B="$_ROOT/.claude/skills/workflow/browse/dist/browse"
[ -z "$B" ] && B="$HOME/.claude/skills/workflow/browse/dist/browse"
if [ -x "$B" ]; then
  echo "READY: $B"
else
  echo "NEEDS_SETUP"
fi
```

If `NEEDS_SETUP`:
1. Tell the user: "workflow browse needs a one-time build (~10 seconds). OK to proceed?" Then STOP and wait.
2. Run: `cd <SKILL_DIR> && ./setup`
3. If `bun` is not installed:
   ```bash
   if ! command -v bun >/dev/null 2>&1; then
     BUN_VERSION="1.3.10"
     BUN_INSTALL_SHA="bab8acfb046aac8c72407bdcce903957665d655d7acaa3e11c7c4616beae68dd"
     tmpfile=$(mktemp)
     curl -fsSL "https://bun.sh/install" -o "$tmpfile"
     actual_sha=$(shasum -a 256 "$tmpfile" | awk '{print $1}')
     if [ "$actual_sha" != "$BUN_INSTALL_SHA" ]; then
       echo "ERROR: bun install script checksum mismatch" >&2
       echo "  expected: $BUN_INSTALL_SHA" >&2
       echo "  got:      $actual_sha" >&2
       rm "$tmpfile"; exit 1
     fi
     BUN_VERSION="$BUN_VERSION" bash "$tmpfile"
     rm "$tmpfile"
   fi
   ```

### 2. Open the cookie picker

```bash
$B cookie-import-browser
```

This auto-detects installed Chromium browsers and opens
an interactive picker UI in your default browser where you can:
- Switch between installed browsers
- Search domains
- Click "+" to import a domain's cookies
- Click trash to remove imported cookies

Tell the user: **"Cookie picker opened — select the domains you want to import in your browser, then tell me when you're done."**

### 3. Direct import (alternative)

If the user specifies a domain directly (e.g., `/setup-browser-cookies github.com`), skip the UI:

```bash
$B cookie-import-browser comet --domain github.com
```

Replace `comet` with the appropriate browser if specified.

### 4. Verify

After the user confirms they're done:

```bash
$B cookies
```

Show the user a summary of imported cookies (domain counts).

## Notes

- On macOS, the first import per browser may trigger a Keychain dialog — click "Allow" / "Always Allow"
- On Linux, `v11` cookies may require `secret-tool`/libsecret access; `v10` cookies use Chromium's standard fallback key
- Cookie picker is served on the same port as the browse server (no extra process)
- Only domain names and cookie counts are shown in the UI — no cookie values are exposed
- The browse session persists cookies between commands, so imported cookies work immediately
